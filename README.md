The "gpt-token-counter-live" is a Visual Studio Code extension that displays the token count of selected text or the entire open document in the status bar. The token count is determined per model family using: [GPT via tiktoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiktoken), [Claude via Anthropic's tokenizer](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-tokenizer-typescript), and Gemini via a local approximation.

This tool is built to get a speedy token counting result right on VS Code while you are working on prompting files. I personally needed a lot while working on many LLM projects, so I decided to make one for myself. I hope this helps you too!

## Features

- **Token Count Display:** The extension provides a real-time token count of the currently selected text or the entire document if no text is selected. The token count is displayed on the right side of the status bar.

- **Auto-Update:** The token count is automatically updated as you edit or select text, ensuring that the count is always accurate.

- **Easy Activation:** The extension is activated as soon as VS Code starts up, so you don't have to manually activate it every time you start your editor.

- **Model Family Selection:** Choose a model family instead of individual versions. Click the token count in the status bar and select one of: GPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), or Gemini (Google AI).
  - **GPT:** Uses tiktoken `encoding_for_model('gpt-5')` to follow the latest GPT mapping. Falls back to `o200k_base`, then `cl100k_base` when needed.
  - **Claude:** Uses Anthropic's tokenizer-based approximation for the Claude family (not an exact, model-official tokenizer for all Claude versions). Counts are close but may differ slightly from server-side accounting.
  - **Gemini:** No public local tokenizer. Approximated using `o200k_base`/`cl100k_base` when available, otherwise ~4 characters per token.
